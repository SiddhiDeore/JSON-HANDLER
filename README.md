# JSON to MySQL Data Handler

This repository contains tools and scripts for processing JSON data, filtering it based on specified keys, and converting the structured data into a MySQL database format. The project leverages Python, specifically utilizing libraries such as SQLAlchemy for database interactions and simple JSON operations for data manipulation.

## Features

- **JSON Data Filtering**: Filters JSON data to include only whitelisted keys, ensuring that the data stored in the database is relevant and secure.
- **MySQL Integration**: Converts and stores filtered JSON data into a MySQL database, using SQLAlchemy to handle database operations efficiently.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that the data meets specific criteria before it is processed and stored, enhancing data integrity and reliability.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
